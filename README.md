# **The Impact of Food Prices on Health**

## **Overview**  
This project explores the relationship between food prices and health outcomes in Nigeria and Niger. Rising food costs can limit access to nutritious diets, leading to malnutrition, undernourishment, and other diet-related health issues. Using data provided by **Amdor Analytics**, this analysis provides actionable insights to address food affordability and improve public health.

## **Project Objectives**  
1. **Examine the affordability of a healthy diet.**  
2. **Analyze the prevalence of undernourishment and its correlation with food prices.**  
3. **Identify key factors influencing high food prices.**  
4. **Understand the health implications of unaffordable diets.**  
5. **Provide evidence-based recommendations to policymakers and stakeholders.**

---

## **Dataset**  
The dataset includes:  
1. Daily Cost of Healthy Diet per Person  
2. Monthly Food Price Index (CFPI)  
3. Share of Population Unable to Afford a Healthy Diet  
4. Prevalence of Undernourishment  
5. Employment Distribution by Sector (Agriculture, Industry, Services)

## **Methodology**  

### **1. Data Cleaning and Transformation**  
- Handled null and duplicate values using **Power Query** in Power BI.  
- Ensured data integrity for accurate visualizations.  

### **2. Key Metrics and Calculations (DAX)**  
- **AvgUnaffordablePopulation:** Average population percentage unable to afford a healthy diet.  
- **AvgDailyCost:** Average daily cost of a healthy diet in USD.  
- **AvgUndernourished:** Average prevalence of undernourishment (%).  
- **AvgCFPI:** Average Food Price Index (CFPI).  

### **3. Visualization and Dashboard**  
A single-page dashboard was created in **Power BI**, featuring:  
1. **Doughnut Chart:** Employment distribution across Agriculture, Industry, and Services.  
2. **Clustered Bar Chart:** Comparison of Health and Affordability Metrics by Country.  
3. **Line Chart:** Trends in the average cost of healthy food over the years for Nigeria and Niger.

## **Findings**  

1. **Population Unable to Afford Diet (%):** 91.75%  
2. **Average Daily Cost of Healthy Diet (USD):** 3.40 USD  
3. **Undernourishment Rate (%):** 12.73%  
4. **Food Price Index (CFPI):** -0.06  

### **Key Insights:**  
- A significant percentage of the population in both countries cannot afford a healthy diet.  
- High food costs exacerbate malnutrition and undernourishment.  
- Employment is heavily concentrated in agriculture, indicating potential for economic diversification.

## **Recommendations**  
1. **Policy Interventions:**  
   - Subsidize nutritious foods to improve affordability.  
   - Stabilize food prices through targeted economic policies.  

2. **Economic Development:**  
   - Support agricultural productivity and resource access.  
   - Foster employment diversification to improve income levels.  

3. **Awareness Campaigns:**  
   - Educate communities on affordable, nutritious diets.  
   - Partner with local organizations for health education programs.
